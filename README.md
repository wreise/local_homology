# Local homology

Currently, two ways to calculate "local homology" are implemented:
1. Calculate relative homology of simplicial complexes. See duality tutorial.
2. Calculate the homology of the pair dual vs 

## Installation
It is advised to start from a clean environment and install directly from gitlab:
```
conda create -n my_new_env python=3.8
conda activate my_new_env
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/wreise/local_homology.git
```
